#### Description of Tables and Metrics

Data is attributed to the day *prior* to the date on the WCHD report. This is done in an attempt to align the data with the state Department of Health practice of making data public the day after it is received.

1. *State Metrics: This Week (Daily)* provides metrics for each day of the
current week. Positivity rates are colored inline with the state's targets
of 0%-5% (Minimal),5%-8% (Moderate), and 8%+(Substantial). Yellow indicates moderate levels of community spread and red indicates signs substantial spread.

2. *State Metrics: Four Weeks (Weekly)* provides data on the current week as well as three weeks prior. For the current week, the Positivity rate and the rates of change for new and youth cases are based off of data reported thus far. They will change as new tests come in. The data for prior weeks should mirror the county stats reported by IL DPH but are often off a little. The discripency is likely owed to that the state attributes tests to the day their results are actually received and these dates are based on when they're reported. It seemse likely that reports might contain tests spanning 1-2 days. Boxes are again colored to reflect the state's recommended bench marks. If both positivity and cases per 100k are red, then the county was probably on the orange warning list. New and Youth cases include the percent change from the last week. When this cannot be computed due to zero reported tests then either None or + is reported. The later indicates a change from zero cases one week to one or more the next where the former indicates zero cases for two weeks in a row. When an increase is observed for two weeks in a row, the cell will be colored. State targets don't readily apply to the relatively large changes we typically see so any two weeks of consecutive change are flagged.

3. *Day-to-Day Trends* is to be read along-side the daily metric table to assess the current trajectory of state community spread metrics during the current week, i.e. the week the state has not yet evaluated. The *Day-to-Day increases* columns count the number of times the metric increased within the stated time window. The state uses this kind of count as part of their regional warning system. For example, they will flag a region if it's positivity rate increases 7 out of 10 days regardless of the actual rate. I've added a similar count for new cases and new youth cases. The 7 day average of the positivity rate is what the state tracks at the regional level as well. It represents the average positivity rate for the last 7 days and aligns with the weekly values at the end of the week.  

4. *This Month vs Last* provides some long-range historical context by looking at key metrics for the current month and one month prior. Like with weekly reporting, the current month values will change day-to-day as new reports are issued by WCHD: positivity rate could go up and down where the others only go up.
