I've started the process of moving all my local COVID-19 work to a publicly
available repository so that others can reproduce my work as desired. With this new public home comes the ability to move my pandemic reporting work
to this site and keep it independent of my academic, professional site. I'll be updating this
site over the next week, will start posting weekly reports here, and will, at some point, move
all my previous reports to this site. In the meantime, there is now a [daily
dashboard](/wcil-covid-reporting/wcil-daily-report/) for WCHD reported data. It's all tables right now. No visuals yet.
Details about the different statistics as well as tweaks to the content
will come in the future. Time permitting, I'll post a look at the 9/20-9/26 data before the end of the weekend. You can at least draw some conclusions from what's in the dashboard.
