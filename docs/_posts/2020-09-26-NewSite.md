I've started the process of moving all my local COVID-19 work to a publicly
available repository. Along side that I'm moving my pandemic reporting work
to a site independent of my academic, professional site. I'll be updating this
site over the next week, will start posting weekly reports here, and may also move
all my previous reports to this site. In the meantime, there is now a [daily
dashboard](/wcil-daily-report/) site. It's all tables right now. No graphics yet.
Details about the different statistics as well as tweaks to the content
will come in the future. I'll try to post a weekly report tomorrow, but I might
just double up next week. You can at least draw your own conclusions from the
daily data.
