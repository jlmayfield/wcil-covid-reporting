Just a couple of quick updates:
1. It seems that IDPH no longer updates numbers over the weekend but does backfill the weekend numbers on Monday. As a result, the site won't update until Monday when IDPH pushes new numbers.
2. There is now a regularly updated regional report that focuses on cases and vaccination rates. [WCIL Regional Report]({{ site.baseurl }}/wcil-regional-report/)
