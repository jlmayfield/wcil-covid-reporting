Since COVID-19 arrived in Warren County, Illinois in April of 2020, [I](https://jlmayfield.github.io/)
have been recording test reports issued by the [Warren County Health Department](http://warrencohealth.com/covid-19.html) and
following data provided by the [Illinois Department of Public Health](https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/covid19-statistics),
and [USAFacts.org](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/). My origial goal was
to better understand the state of the pandemic in and around Monmouth, IL so that my family could make
sound, informed decisions about the risks facing us during the global pandemic. This very quickly turned into
preparing graphics to share with the community as I knew other people might be interested in a more detailed
look at what was happening in our community. Early reporting happened via public posts on Facebook. By the end of summer
I shifted that work to the blog portion of my [personal and professional website](https://jlmayfield.github.io/).
In early fall I began hosting my analysis and visualization scripts on a public GitHub repository. This site grew from that effort.

The design and layout for this site uses the [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
